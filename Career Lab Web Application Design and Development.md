    - Project Steps
        - Frontend
            - Wireframe your application
                - Using pencil and paper, or a wireframing software of your choice, draft what you’d like your application to look like.
                    - Think about what the main components of the site will be and how you would like to see them arranged on the page. You should also think about the user flow and design all of those states and transitions as well. Don’t forget about error states!
                    - You should also think about:
                        - The application’s color palette
                        - How to break up your design into components
                        - How your application will look at different screen sizes
            - Create files and run it locally
                - On your computer, create the files needed for your React application. Run your application locally to see what it looks like in the browser.
                    - You can use [create-react-app](https://create-react-app.dev/) to start your React application. If you want to set up Redux automatically, you can use [the Redux flag](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/introduction/quick-start#using-create-react-app).
            - Version control
                - Set up the folder you created previously to be a Git repository. Push the initial files to a repository on GitHub. You should be consistently committing your changes throughout the project. Make sure to have meaningful commit messages.
                    - To initialize your Git repository, you can run the following code in your terminal, where application is the name of your project folder. `git init application`
            - Build the application
                - Based on your wireframes, start building your application with fake, local data. Remember to build reusable components and to keep your components small.
                - Other things to keep in mind:
                    - Your application should work for all screen sizes
                    - You are welcome to use libraries to help you accomplish features
                    - You should write unit tests and end-to-end tests where it makes sense
            - Connect to real data
                - If using an API, connect your application to it.
                - When interacting with the API, don’t forget to handle error states.
            - Publish to the web
                - Congratulations on building your application! Deploy what you’ve built and share it with the world!
                    - There are many ways to deploy your application online. You deploy it with GitHub pages, Netlify or choose your own option.
            - Optimize your app
                - Test your application on Lighthouse. Improve your app until it gets a score of 90 or higher.
                    - Make sure your app is accessible, quick to load, and uses SEO best practices.
        - Backend 
            - Plan your project
                - Visualize your end result. 
                    - What is it built with? What can it do? Make sure that it satisfies all of the project objectives.
                - Make a timeline for yourself.
                    - Avoid the temptation to build things that aren’t required. Setting firm boundaries and deadlines will keep you on track and prevent [scope creep](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scope_creep).
                - Track specific tasks with a Kanban board
                    -  On [Trello](https://trello.com/) or with sticky notes.
                    - (I'll be using Roam Research)
            - Version Control
                - Set up Git tracking in your directory and make sure to add and commit changes as you make them.
            - Set up the environment and create your server
                - Create an Express app that runs on localhost:3000/ in your browser.
            - Design your database
                - Before jumping into the code, design your database and identify what to include and what not to include in your tables and their relationships.
            - Create your db and connect it to your server
                - In your terminal, create a PostgreSQL database with a name of your choosing. If you choose to use an ORM like Sequelize, configure it now.
            - Create your model(s)
                - Create model(s) for your database. If you are using Sequelize, use the sequelize-cli package to create your model(s). If you are not using Sequelize, it is still a good idea to map your database objects to object models in your code.
            - Create your endpoints
                - Think about how you want to organize your routes and design the endpoints. What middleware will you use? What do you want your requests and responses to look like?
                    - Think about your project structure and where you should place route controllers depending on their purpose.
                    - Test your endpoints with Postman as you create them.
                    - Now is a good opportunity to start documenting your API using Swagger. Continue to do so as you work on your API.
            - Add authentication and authorization
                - Decide how you want to implement Authentication and Authorization in your application.
                - Create login, logout, and registration endpoints as needed.
                - Create authentication/authorization middleware and add it to the appropriate endpoints to restrict access to secure endpoints.
                - You can use the bcrypt library for a custom auth scheme, or leverage a package like [Passport.js](http://www.passportjs.org/) if you want to use OAuth.
                - Use appropriate status codes when unauthorized users try to access secure endpoints.
                - Remember to make use of you the Headers and Body tabs that Postman provides in order to check your authentication endpoints.
            - Document your API
                - Using Swagger, write up documentation for your API.
                - Try to be as descriptive as possible and give examples of what your data should look like. Good documentation should read as a manual for end users so be sure to write it in a specific, concise, and relevant way.
            - Deploy your application with Heroku
                - Push your local changes to your remote GitHub repository and deploy your application using Heroku.
        - Full Stack
            - Plan the MVP (Minimum Viable Product)
                - Create a list of features for your project’s MVP
                    - When starting a new project, it is extremely helpful to scope the features for the MVP (Minimum Viable Product). The list of features can be as exhaustive as you would like, but make sure to take careful stock of what features are absolutely necessary for the base functionality of your application, and which features can be saved for future feature updates once MVP has been launched.
            - Create a Mockup (Front-End)
                - Create a mockup of your front-end
                    - Creating a mockup of the front-end of your application helps to solidify a visual plan before development begins. It not only allows you to plan for different display sizes, but also allows you to begin the process of breaking the application up into React Components conceptually before implementation.
            - Break the UI into Components
                - Identify what React components can be derived from the UI mockup
                    - If you have problems defining what parts of the UI should be relegated to their own components, the use of the [single responsibility principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-responsibility_principle) can be helpful. Generally, you should aim for a component to have responsibility for a single piece of functionality within your application.
            - Arrange components into a hierarchy
                - Create a component hierarchy in your folder structure
                    - Creating a component hierarchy can help you articulate what components are dependent on others and how they will interact. You can most easily do this by looking at the mockup you created and identifying which components are nested inside of each other.
            - Define where state should live
                - Define which components should manage application state
                    - React applications should have a top-down data flow. Planning which components will manage state in your application ahead of time will allow you to more effectively implement this when development begins. Make sure to consider whether you may benefit from the use of a state management package such as [Redux](https://redux.js.org/).
            - Implement your Front-End
                - Use the plans drafted in previous steps and implement them as code
                    - Approach development one feature at a time. Generally, working on “bigger picture” aspects of the application and narrowing focus as you progress works well. For instance, implement an App component, followed by different page components, followed by the components that are contained within each of those pages.
            - Plan the Back-end
                - Plan your back-end resources by mocking what resources you will use and how you will persist/communicate them. Determine what API endpoints you will have to facilitate this as well as what database tables are required.
                    - Think about what data your application cares about and how that data can be structured. For instance, in an e-commerce application you may care about products, users, orders, etc. Identifying the key data resources will help you decide how you store them, their relations to each other, and how you can most efficiently expose that data to the client.
            - Create the database
                - Create the database tables that will be used to persist data
                    - Make sure to plan the relationships between your tables in advance. You can use a tool such as an ERD ([Entity Relationship Diagram](https://www.lucidchart.com/pages/er-diagrams)) to do this visually. One popular tool for created ERDs is [ERDPlus](https://erdplus.com/).
            - Create the Express server
                - Create an Express server and the API handlers responsible for processing data requests.
                    - Endpoints should handle a single job and should be descriptive of their function in their naming. For instance, an endpoint that is responsible for retrieving products could be called /products while an endpoint focusing on retrieving a single product could be called /products/{id}.
            - Secure your endpoints
                - Add security to your endpoints to protect your data.
                    - Consider what data should be private and make sure to guard access to the endpoints that handle it. You can do this by creating an authentication middleware in front of those endpoints to verify credentials of users requesting access. Additionally, try adding data sanitization/validation to your endpoints to help prevent malicious data from wreaking havoc and bugs in general.
            - Create tests
                - Create tests for the front and backends to ensure the integrity of your code.
                    - Writing tests for your code is a great way to ensure the integrity of that code and to have a more efficient development process in the long run. You can choose to develop tests as you implement code, or develop tests later on. There are benefits to both strategies, but ultimately any application should have tests, regardless of when in the process they are created.
            - Deploy to Heroku
                - Deploy your codebase to Heroku for the world to see.
                    - Use the Heroku CLI to deploy your app and make sure to set up Heroku Postgres. If you are using environment variables, add them as config vars on Heroku. This video walks through some additional steps you may need to complete in order to successfully deploy your PERN app to Heroku.

                    - Domain and Branding: Secure the domain "[www.careerlab.ai](http://www.careerlab.ai/)" and any related social media handles to establish a consistent brand presence across different platforms.
                    - Development Team: Assemble a team of developers, data scientists, and designers to work on the application. This team will be responsible for creating the front-end user interface, back-end infrastructure, and AI components.
                    - OpenAI API Integration: Research the OpenAI API to understand how to integrate it into your application for generating custom, targeted documents. This will be a crucial component of your app and may require working closely with OpenAI for best results.
                    - Web Scrapers and Data Collection: Develop web scrapers that can collect relevant career and labor market information from various sources across the internet. This data will be used for analytics, job recommendations, and to update your AI models.
                    - Database and Storage: Set up a robust and secure database system to store user information, generated documents, and collected data. This will be essential for maintaining organization and ensuring users can access their information easily.
                    - Freemium Model: Design the features and limitations of your freemium model, ensuring that users have a clear understanding of what they will receive at each tier. This will help encourage conversions to paid accounts.
                    - Marketing Strategy
                    - Marketing Strategy: Develop a comprehensive marketing strategy to reach your target audience, focusing on students and young adults. Utilize various channels such as social media, content marketing, and targeted advertising to create awareness and drive user adoption.

                    - Expansion and Scalability: As your user base grows, be prepared to scale your infrastructure and resources to meet the increasing demand. Consider potential opportunities for expanding your application to new markets or offering additional features and services.
                - By following these steps and being adaptable to changes in the market, your software company and Career Lab application have the potential for success in the competitive career development industry.

                    - As an AI language model, I don't possess personal opinions or emotions. However, I can provide an objective analysis of your idea.
                    - The Career Lab application idea appears to be well-thought-out and has the potential to be successful in the market. The main features you've outlined address several pain points in the job search and career planning process, which can make the app valuable to users.
                    - The focus on creating targeted documents, organizing job searches, providing labor market analytics, and aiding in career planning aligns well with the needs of students, young professionals, and anyone seeking to advance their career. Offering a freemium model can help attract users, and the tiered subscription system can cater to various needs and budgets.
                    - Utilizing a microservices architecture, along with a modular and granular approach, is a smart choice for scalability, maintainability, and adaptability. Integrating AI-powered components, such as OpenAI API and custom-trained models, can provide a competitive edge and enhance the user experience.
                    - Overall, the idea has strong potential, and with proper execution, marketing, and continuous improvement, it could become a popular and valuable tool in the career development space.
                - Constructive Feedback (When asked directly for cons)
                    - While the Career Lab application has strong potential, there are some challenges and drawbacks that you should consider:
                        - Competition: The job search and career planning market is quite competitive, with numerous established platforms and tools available. Standing out among competitors and gaining a significant user base may be challenging.
                        - Complexity: Integrating multiple features, AI components, and data sources can make the application complex, potentially leading to longer development time, higher costs, and increased maintenance requirements.
                        - Data Privacy and Security: Handling user data, especially sensitive career and personal information, requires strict adherence to data privacy regulations, such as GDPR and CCPA. Ensuring data security and compliance can be time-consuming and resource-intensive.
                        - User adoption: Convincing users to switch from their current tools and processes to the Career Lab application may be difficult. Providing a seamless onboarding experience and clearly communicating the unique benefits of the platform will be crucial.
                        - Monetization challenges: With the freemium model, there is always a risk of users not converting to paid plans, limiting revenue generation. Striking the right balance between free and paid features is crucial for encouraging users to upgrade.
                        - Keeping up with the evolving job market: The job market and hiring trends are constantly changing, and the application must be continuously updated to remain relevant and valuable to users. This may require significant time and resources dedicated to research, development, and adaptation.
                        - Dependence on external data sources: The labor market analytics feature relies on external data sources, which can be subject to changes or become unavailable. Ensuring the quality and reliability of data sources is important to maintain the accuracy and usefulness of the analytics feature.
                        - Scalability: As the user base grows, the application must be designed to scale accordingly. Handling increased traffic, data storage, and processing needs can be challenging and may require additional investments in infrastructure and optimization.
                        - AI limitations: While AI-powered components like OpenAI API and custom-trained models can provide valuable insights and automation, they may still have limitations in understanding complex human behavior or preferences. Ensuring that the AI components are accurate, reliable, and continually updated is essential to maintain the app's effectiveness.
                        - Marketing and promotion: Reaching the target audience and effectively promoting the Career Lab application will require a well-thought-out marketing strategy and potentially significant investment in advertising and promotional activities.
                - Second
                    - Great, it seems like you have a clear understanding of the overall idea and the desired stack. I'm happy to provide some feedback and recommendations on your app idea and directory structure.
                    - Firstly, I think your app idea is compelling and could solve a real pain point for job seekers. The four main parts of the app are well-thought-out and seem to cover the key aspects of the career management process. The freemium model is a smart approach to attract users and allow them to try the basic features before committing to a paid subscription. I also like the idea of incorporating the Australian blueprint for career success into the career development content, as it adds credibility and a unique selling point to your app.
                    - In terms of your directory structure, it seems to be well-organized and follows the MVC architecture. However, I noticed that you have a separate directory for web scrapers and machine learning components. While it's important to have these functionalities, I recommend integrating them into the appropriate microservices, as it will help with modularity and maintainability. For example, the data collection and processing components of the labor market analytics microservice should include the web scrapers, and the text analysis component of the document generation microservice should include the machine learning components.
                    - Regarding your microservices and component breakdown, it looks like you've identified the key functionalities and components required for each microservice. However, I suggest considering some additional components that could enhance the user experience and make your app stand out from competitors. For example, you could incorporate a job matching component that uses machine learning to recommend job postings based on the user's skills and preferences.

        - Scalability Implementation Plan
            - Review the current architecture: 
                - Before implementing any scalability measures, it's important to review the current architecture of the application to understand where the potential bottlenecks and scalability issues may lie. 
                - This includes reviewing the current infrastructure, application code, and database schema.
            - Identify scalability requirements: 
                - Once the current architecture has been reviewed, it's important to identify the scalability requirements of the application. 
                - This includes understanding the expected user load, peak usage times, and growth projections over time.
            - Implement horizontal scaling: 
                - One of the most common ways to scale an application is through horizontal scaling, which involves adding more instances of the application to handle increased traffic. 
                - This can be achieved by using load balancers to distribute traffic across multiple instances of the application, or by using containerization technologies such as Docker to spin up new instances as needed.
            - Implement vertical scaling: 
                - Vertical scaling involves increasing the resources available to each instance of the application, such as adding more CPU, RAM, or disk space to the servers hosting the application. 
                - This can help improve the performance of the application and handle increased traffic.
            - Implement caching: 
                - Caching can be used to improve the performance of frequently accessed data by storing it in memory, reducing the need to query the database for every request. 
                - This can be achieved using technologies such as Redis or Memcached.
            - Implement asynchronous processing: 
                - Asynchronous processing can be used to offload heavy processing tasks to background workers, freeing up the main application to handle other requests. 
                - This can be achieved using message queuing systems such as RabbitMQ or Apache Kafka.
            - Use a content delivery network (CDN): 
                - A CDN can be used to distribute static assets such as images, videos, and files across multiple servers located around the world, reducing the load on the main application servers and improving the performance for users accessing the application from different geographic locations.
            - Monitor and optimize: 
                - Once the scalability measures have been implemented, it's important to monitor the application performance and make optimizations as needed. 
                - This includes monitoring server load, response times, and error rates, as well as performing regular load testing to ensure the application can handle expected user loads. 
                - Optimization can be achieved through techniques such as database indexing, code profiling, and optimizing server configurations.
            - Implement auto-scaling: 
                - Finally, to ensure that the application can handle sudden spikes in traffic, it may be necessary to implement auto-scaling. 
                - This involves setting up systems to automatically spin up new instances of the application or increase resources to existing instances in response to increased traffic. 
                - This can be achieved using technologies such as AWS Auto Scaling or Google Cloud Autoscaler.
            - By implementing these measures, the application can be made more scalable and able to handle increasing user loads over time.

        - Implementation Decisions History
            - Decisions
                - Colab Migration
                    - The decision was made to migrate to Colab due to concerns regarding package compatibility with a Mac system, and the preference to avoid storing all code on a work computer.
                - Migration away from colab back to local development
                    - Colab does not persist code files long term
                    - Therefore, we have migrated development back to a local machine
                - Migrate from `pytest` to `unittest`
                    - steps
                        - Remove pytest from your project's dependencies. You can do this by uninstalling pytest using pip: pip uninstall pytest.
                        - Install the unittest library, which is part of Python's standard library and doesn't need to be installed separately: pip install unittest.
                        - Replace any pytest imports in your code with unittest imports. For example, replace import pytest with import unittest.
                        - Modify your test files to use the unittest framework instead of pytest. Here are some key differences between the two:
                            - pytest uses the assert keyword for assertions, while unittest uses assertion methods like assertEqual, assertTrue, etc. You'll need to update your assertions accordingly.
                            - pytest automatically discovers and runs all files with names that match the pattern test_*.py. unittest requires you to explicitly define test cases and test suites in your code. You'll need to update your test files accordingly.
                        - Run your tests using the unittest command instead of the pytest command. For example, instead of running pytest, you'd run python -m unittest discover to discover and run all of your test cases.
                - Whether to use 3rd party apis in the template_management_component
                    - Considerations
                        - Using third-party APIs can be a good idea as they allow us to access a wealth of data without the need to store it all locally, which can be especially useful for data-intensive applications like dictionaries. However, as you mentioned, relying on external APIs does introduce additional complexity and potential maintenance issues.
                        - One issue is that the API might change or become unavailable, causing issues with our application. Additionally, depending on the frequency and volume of API calls, it could lead to performance issues or unexpected costs if the API is not free.
                        - It's important to carefully consider the trade-offs when using external APIs, and to have contingency plans in place in case the API becomes unavailable or unusable. One potential solution to mitigate some of these risks is to cache the API responses, so that the application can continue to function even if the API is down or unavailable.
                    - Cost Considerations Per 3rd party API
                        - Merriam-Webster offers two free API keys upon registration for non-commercial use. For commercial use, a licensing fee is required, and if the application uses more than 1,000 queries per day, a licensing fee is also required. The API supports JSON format and requires the Merriam-Webster logo to be featured in applications using their APIs.
                        - COCA provides basic access to corpora for free, with a premium account available for purchase. A premium account offers increased search limits, more saved lists, virtual corpora, customized word lists, and more search history. The income from premium accounts helps maintain the corpora and provides access for lower-income students or teachers in developing countries.
                        - WordNet is unencumbered and can be used in commercial applications without a fee or royalty. A license agreement is available in the LICENSE file in any downloaded version of WordNet.
                        - The Data Muse API can be used without any restrictions or the need for an API key for up to 100,000 requests per day. However, if you require a custom vocabulary, plan to make more than 100,000 requests per day, or use the API in a customer-facing application, you will need to describe your application and estimated traffic in a message to the Data Muse team.
                            - It's worth noting that while the API is currently free and available for use, there are no commitments to future improvements or support requests.
                            - If you use the Data Muse API within a publicly available app, you are required to acknowledge the API within your app's documentation.
                    - Final Conclusion
                        - Based on the specific methods used in this code, the chosen APIs appear to be suitable for their intended purposes. However, it's important to note that there may be other APIs available that could be considered depending on the specific requirements and use cases of the template management component.
                        - For the "get_definition", "get_synonyms", "get_antonyms", and "get_pronunciation" methods, the Merriam-Webster API is a solid choice as it offers comprehensive information on English words, including definitions, synonyms, antonyms, and pronunciation. However, there are other dictionary and thesaurus APIs, such as the Oxford Dictionaries API, Wordnik API, or Thesaurus.com API, that could be considered depending on specific needs. For example, the Oxford Dictionaries API covers a wider range of English dialects and variants compared to the Merriam-Webster API.
                        - For the "get_examples" method, the Corpus of Contemporary American English (COCA) API is a good choice as it provides a large corpus of contemporary American English text that can be used to find examples of word usage. However, there are other text corpora and example APIs, such as the Oxford English Corpus or the WordHippo API, that could be considered depending on the specific needs of the project.
                        - For the "get_word_forms" method, the WordNet API is a good choice as it is a widely used lexical database that provides information on the semantic relationships between words, including word forms. However, other lexical databases and APIs, such as the Global WordNet API or the WordHippo API, could be considered depending on the specific needs of the project.
                        - For the "get_related_words" and "get_collocations" methods, the DataMuse API is a good choice as it provides a variety of word-related data, including related words and collocations. However, there are other APIs that could be considered depending on the specific needs of the project.
                        - For the "check_industry_term_frequency" method, the Indeed API could be a suitable choice as it provides job listings that can be searched for occurrences of the given term within a specified industry. However, there may be other APIs available that could be considered depending on specific needs.
                        - In conclusion, the chosen APIs appear to be appropriate for their intended purposes, but it's important to evaluate the available APIs and choose the ones that best fit the needs of the application. Factors to consider include cost, ease of use, availability of documentation and support, as well as the advantages and disadvantages of each API. It is my belief that these factors will make themselves known throughout the implementation and deployment.
                - Decision to create internal apis rather than rely on third party apis in the template_management_component
                    - Reason
                        - Reliance on third party apis is too high risk given you cannot control the functionality or access to the functionality. 
                        - This would make more sense if we absolutely had to or if it was a simple utility app, but not for a comprehensive web application
                    - Plan to create internal apis for template_management_component

                            - We'll need to implement various methods for each component, such as retrieving and setting the text content, retrieving metadata like length and sentiment score, filtering components by industry, and generating variations of the component based on input parameters like tone, formality, and relevance to a particular industry. Additionally, we'll need to create methods for interacting with the external APIs that we'll be using for NLP, keyword extraction, semantic similarity, sentiment analysis, and summarization.

                            - For each microservice or component, we'll need to implement the necessary functionality and write unit tests, integration tests, and any additional tests as necessary to ensure that everything is working correctly. We'll also need to optimize the performance of each component to handle high traffic and large amounts of data.
                            - In addition, we'll need to ensure that the different microservices and components are integrated and communicating with each other correctly, so that we can provide the desired functionality to the end users.
                    - List of Services/APIs
                        - Need to Be Implemented
                            - Natural Language Processing (NLP) API: 
                                - for analyzing the structure and content of text, including sentiment analysis, part-of-speech tagging, named entity recognition, and dependency parsing.
                            - Semantic Similarity API:
                                - for measuring the similarity between two pieces of text based on their meaning or context.
                            - Summarization API:
                                - for generating a summary of a longer piece of text.
                            - Job Search API:
                                - for collecting data on common job descriptions and industry-related terms.
                            - Variations API:
                                - for generating variations of text components such as phrases, sentences, paragraphs, and section titles.
                        - Already Completed (within services of Text Analysis Component)
                            - Sentiment Analysis API: for analyzing the sentiment or emotional tone of a piece of text.
                                - This one will probably need to be refactored to make use of the internal NLP API we are building
                            - Keyword Extraction API: for extracting the key words or phrases from a text document.
        - Environment Setup
            - Local Setup
                - Steps:
                    - Create a new directory for the project: mkdir career_lab_app
                    - Move into the new directory: cd career_lab_app
                    - Initialize a new Git repository: git init
                    - Create a virtual environment for the project using virtualenv. First, make sure virtualenv is installed by running pip install virtualenv. Then, create a new virtual environment named env by running: virtualenv env
                    - Activate the virtual environment by running source env/bin/activate. Once activated, the command prompt will change to indicate that you are now working within the virtual environment.
                    - Now, we'll install the necessary Python packages using pip. The package dependencies for each microservice will be listed in their respective requirements.txt files. To install the dependencies for the Document Generation microservice, run pip install -r document_generation_service/text_analysis_component/requirements.txt.
                    - Next, we'll set up the development database. In this case, we'll use SQLite, which does not require a separate installation. Simply create a new directory called db in the project root: mkdir db
                    - Finally, we'll create a Dockerfile for the Document Generation microservice. This will be used to build a Docker image for the service, which we can then use to deploy and run the service. You can find an example Dockerfile in the document_generation_service/text_analysis_component directory.
            - Colab Setup
                - It's a good practice to create a virtual environment for your project in Google Colab to keep the dependencies separate and organized. 
                - You can create a virtual environment in Google Colab and install the required packages from the requirements.txt file.
                - Here are the steps to create and activate a virtual environment in Google Colab:
                    - Preliminary Steps
                        - Open a new Colab notebook and click on "Runtime" in the menu bar.
                        - Select "Change runtime type" from the drop-down menu.
                        - Select "Python 3" as the runtime type and select "GPU" or "TPU" as the hardware accelerator if you need it.
                        - Click on "Create" to create a new runtime.
                    - Create Virtual Environment
                        - Open a new terminal window and type the following command to install virtualenv:
                            - code
                                - ```python
pip install virtualenv```
                        - Create a new virtual environment by typing the following command in a the terminal:
                            - Code
                                - ```python
virtualenv myenv```
                        - This will create a new virtual environment called myenv in your current directory.
                    - Activate Virtual Environment
                        - Activate the virtual environment by typing the following command:
                            - Code
                                - ```python
source myenv/bin/activate```
                        - This will activate the `myenv` virtual environment.
                    - Install Dependencies
                        - Now, you can install the required packages from the requirements.txt file by typing the following command:
                            - Code
                                - ```python
pip install -r /path/to/requirements.txt```
                        - Replace /path/to/requirements.txt with the path to the requirements.txt file in your project.
                        - After installing the required packages, you can start working on your project within the virtual environment. 
                        - Resolving conflicts:
                            - code 1
                                - `pip install -r ./document_generation_service/text_analysis_component/requirements.txt --upgrade --force-reinstall
`
                            - code 2
                                - `pip install -r ./document_generation_service/text_analysis_component/requirements.txt --upgrade-strategy only-if-needed`

                - Don't forget to deactivate the virtual environment by typing deactivate in the code cell when you're done.
                - Perform pull request for github repo
                    - code
                        - `git clone https://github.com/danielemiller/career_lab_app.git`
                - Add the microservices and components to the python path variable so that they can be recognized by the Pytest module
                    - code 1

                    - I would like the template manager to support the creation of components such as bullet points and sections, so the unit tests need to be refactored to ensure that the new functionality is covered. 
                    - Bullet points, sections, and entire documents can be components. Users should be able to pick and choose specific sections and/or bullet points from various templates to be imported into the document builder
                    - Please add new tests to check that bullet points and sections can be created, edited, and deleted accurately and efficiently, and that they can be retrieved and loaded into the document builder correctly. You may also need to modify the existing tests to account for the new component functionality.
                    - In addition, you may need to add new tests or modify the existing ones to ensure that users can pick and choose specific sections and/or bullet points from various templates to be imported into the document builder correctly.
                - how the component class is used in the document builder component to create words, phrases, and bullet point classes which are children classes of the component class.
                    - ![Daniel Miller %28Astro%29](https://chat.openai.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Flh3.googleusercontent.com%2Fa%2FAGNmyxZIM3GAGecwFxYHEcjktMx8FeJbQeGw0bWstE8EXg%3Ds96-c&w=64&q=75)
                    - gotcha, so you're saying that the component class can be used to instantiate a child class bullet point, phrase, or word within the document builder component when the document builder component uses the template manager to create documents?
                    - That's correct! The Component class provides a basic structure that can be used to create different types of components such as bullet points, phrases, or words. The DocumentBuilder component can use the TemplateManager to retrieve the appropriate components for a specific template, and then use the Component class to instantiate each component.
                    - For example, when the DocumentBuilder creates a document using a template that has a bullet point section, it can use the TemplateManager to retrieve the list of bullet points for that section, and then use the Component class to instantiate each bullet point as a BulletPoint object. The BulletPoint class can inherit from the Component class and add any additional functionality that is specific to bullet points.
                    - This way, the DocumentBuilder component can easily create documents using different templates and components, without having to worry about the specifics of each component type.

                        - Overview:
                            - This UML class diagram illustrates the relationships between the classes: Document, Paragraph, Sentence, Section, SectionTitle, Word, Phrase, and BulletPoint. The diagram shows that a Document can have multiple Sections, a Section can have multiple Sentences, and a Sentence can have multiple Words and Phrases. Additionally, a Section can have a SectionTitle and multiple BulletPoints.
                            - Please note that due to the limitations of plain text representation, the attributes and methods of each class are not shown in the diagram. However, the relationships between the classes should be clear from the diagram.

                            - accepts a string as input
                            - returns a dictionary with fields for:
                                - sentiment analysis
                                - part-of-speech tagging
                                - named entity recognition
                                - dependency parsing
                    - Write the high-level test cases:
                        - Write high-level test cases that verify the behavior of the API functions. 
                        - These tests should cover all the expected behaviors of the API, such as handling different text inputs and handling errors.
                    - Implement the API functions:
                        - Implement the API functions using the same components and modules such as the sentiment analysis module, the part-of-speech tagging module, and so on. 
                        - Each component should accept a text input and return the expected output.
                        - Each function should accept the expected input format and return the expected output format.
                    - Write the low-level test cases: 
                        - Write unit tests for each of the individual components that make up the API, such as the sentiment analysis module, the part-of-speech tagging module, and so on. 
                        - These tests should cover all the expected behaviors of each component, such as handling different types of text inputs and returning the correct results.
                    - Implement the individual components:
                        - Implement each of the individual components of the API, such as the sentiment analysis module, the part-of-speech tagging module, and so on.
                        - Each component should accept a text input and return the expected output.
                    - Refactor the code:
                        - Finally, refactor the code to improve its readability, maintainability, and performance. 
                        - This could involve things like extracting common functionality into reusable functions, optimizing performance-critical sections of the code, and improving the documentation.
                - Function Signatures:
